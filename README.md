## Importance of Identifying Design Properties in a Mockup

Identifying the design properties of a mockup â€” such as color styles, typography, spacing, and layout â€” is essential for maintaining consistency, accuracy, and efficiency throughout the design-to-development process. 

Documenting these properties ensures that both designers and developers share a common visual language, helping to maintain brand alignment, reduce errors, and streamline implementation.
